* Efficient and established excellence in working remotely or in-house, alone or as part of a team.

# Work Experience
**Geographer, United States Geological Survey (USGS)**\
**Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (2019–Present)**

Leads development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI)-based object detection models for detecting and classifying wildlife in aerial imagery. Collaborates with teams from the USGS, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), and United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to develop the cohesive technical strategy critical to collecting huge volumes of imagery, creating manual annotations for model training, conducting model training, and deploying models for large-scale inference. These models rapidly increase the understanding of wildlife in areas of offshore energy production to support efficient energy infrastructure development.
